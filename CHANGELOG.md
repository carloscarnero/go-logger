Changes to this project will be documented in this file, in a format based
on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [1.0.0] - 2024-12-03

This release is considered the first stable release. It is also when this
`CHANGELOG.md` file is introduced; a decision made early in the project's
life cycle so as not to polute too much the human-readable history (more
details, most of them boring, are always available in the actual Git
commit history.)

[1.0.0]: https://github.com/carloscarnero/go-logger/releases/tag/v1.0.0
