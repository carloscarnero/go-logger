Retrieve the package with:

```console
go get -u -v go.carloscarnero.stream/go-logger
```

and then it will be ready to use in your project:

```go
package main

import (
    "os"

    "go.carloscarnero.stream/go-logger"
)

func main() {
    // l will be a pointer to a standard library slog.Logger instance. Note
    // that no error handling is included in this example.
    l, _ := logger.New(os.Stdout, "TEXT", "INFO", false)

    l.Info("Hello, world!")
}
```

Running the above program will send `Hello, world!` to the standard output:

```console
level=INFO msg="Hello, world!"
```

> [!NOTE]
> While the module path is `go.carloscarnero.stream/go-logger`, the package
> is called `logger`. This is not very elegant but results from having to
> name the source code repository in that particular way.
